          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>The sections elements will allow us to elegantly organize the content 
            on our page based on the topics we have.</li>
          <li>The section elements are semantic elements that define a section in 
            a document that contains thematic content.</li>
          <li>It is important that we use heading tags in order from h1 to h6.</li>

          <li>Git is a version control system that lets you manage
             and keep track of each version of your project.</li>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li>Using Git commands, we can initiate (or create) a repo, add our code to
             the repo, and view the different versions of our code, which are each stored 
             in a unique commit.</li>
         <li>Git is great for tracking changes locally on your own computer, but to collaborate
           with others, you need to use another tool, GitHub.</li>
         <li>git log: show all commits in the current branch history.</li>
         <li>git pull: fetch and merge any commits from the tracking remote branch.</li>
